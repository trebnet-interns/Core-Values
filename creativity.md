CREATIVITY is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. Creativity is characterised by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing. If you have ideas but don’t act on them, you are imaginative but not creative.


IMPORTANCE OF CREATIVITY 
a) Creativity helps you see the big picture: Being able to see the big picture is important in many areas of life. Whether it’s your personal life or a work project, it’s easy to get bogged down and lost in the details. Being creative and letting your mind meander a bit is like taking a walk in the forest. Rather than stopping to focus on one piece of moss, keep wandering down the path and open up the forest. You’re able to see past the trees, in a way.

b) Creativity helps with problem-solving: When you’re trying to find the solution to a problem, thinking creatively opens up the possibilities. You look at the situation from different angles. Oftentimes, people get stuck on solutions that they’ve always used in the past. While it might still get the job done, it could be done better if it was more creative.

c) Creativity boosts your confidence: Being creative helps you see the big picture, stay motivated, and solve problems. When you think creatively and overcome all kinds of challenges, you’re proving to yourself that you’re a capable person.

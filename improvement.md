Continuous improvement:
 It is a systematic and ongoing approach to making your skills and abilities better. 
 It can also apply to other parts of your life.
 
 How to improve your skills continually
 
 1. Identification of Areas for Improvement: 
 This involves regularly assessing and analyzing your skills to check where you are lacking. 
 It can also be done through feedback from leaders and friends.
 
 2. Setting Objectives: 
 After identifying areas that need improvement, specific and measurable objectives are set. 
 These objectives define what needs to be achieved and provide a clear direction for the improvement efforts.
 
 3.  Learning and Adaptation: Continuous improvement involves a culture of learning. 
 Lessons learned from both successes and failures are used to refine strategies and processes further.

Collaboration in simple terms talks about a joint effort of individudals to achieve a common goal. Relating and Implementing  such core value withhin an organization
(Trebnet) will involve the ability of two or more people  to work together by sharing their respective views on topics and also contribute to the  operations of this organizaton
 in oder to accomplish a task or to acheive a specific goal. Collaboration is ususally more effective via a strong network of involved members , that is a good hosting platform 
 that will allow ideas to be shared more conviniently and faster (effective communication) , technology has provided us with such good hosting platforms (e.g. WhatsApp , Github, 
 Facebook and so on) . By virtue of this we can say technology is key to an effective Collaboration in these our modern times.
 Talking of the essence of Collaboration as a core value in our organizaton (Trebnet), its vital role of uniting members and highligthing the relevance of each member can be 
 stated as one of its importance. Collaboration will not only unite us as one at Trebnet but it will also prove the importance of everyone we are paired to work with regardless 
 of the amount of knowledge they may have pertaining the task available. Even though some collabs may have little knowledge on certains tasks, they can get to prove their 
 importance to us by teaching us some good moral values and other work ethics we may not be familar with, although these things might be off the topic (the available task), 
 they can guide us in our working careeers and even expose us to bigger chances. These will then state the usefulness of every collab we might find ourselves with and hence 
 boost the level of respect among us and also change the mentality of people who believe in doing things alone ("flying solo").
 Although one vital mission of  Trebnet is to train its staff or interns to work remotely, I think collaboration still aligns with the Agency's mission. This is due to 
 the fact where we will be made to work in groups despite the aim of working remotely. The importance of the formation of these groups to me is to build a sense of togetherness
 and also enable we interns to comfortably express ourselves in any social content we may find ourselves. This is why I think collaboration still aligns with Trebnet's mission.

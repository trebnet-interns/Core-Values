Decency is the behavior that conforms to an accepted standard of morality or respectability.
Decency to me comes in different forms. be it how we communicate with others, dress, eat, etc.
Most at times we tend to exhibit decency at formal gatherings which is not to be so. decency i believe should be a way of life.
Eg: In Trebnet, communicating and dressing decently is one of the mostly stressed. because,i believe the exhibition of these goood morals shows how serious,well informed,dedicated and committed you are to be a member of it's family.
